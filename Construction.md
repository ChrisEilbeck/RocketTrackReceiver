# Building a RocketTrackReceiver

This is currently designed to be based on a three button TTGO T-Beam.  The
code is written using Arduino so it could be ported to other platforms in
the same way that RocketTrack has been but I am currently sticking
exclusively to the T-Beam for the receive side of the leg
